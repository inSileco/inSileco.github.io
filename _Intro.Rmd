# Welcome to inSileco!

Congratulations, you are here, on ground zero for this new and revolutionary - in our head at least - blog, ***inSileco***!

If you are here, it's either because you were roped into visiting us - thank you friends and family! - or because you have an acute interest in one or more of the following: ecology, programming and open science.

The overarching goal of this blog is quite straightforward: tackle challenges and opportunities provided by this new era of open-access and computationally intensive research in the field of ecology. You will therefore find a collection of blog posts that reflect this: code snippets, ecological insights, new and exciting computational tools, opinions on various field of ecology and programming, etc.

In the interest of full disclosure, we also have a hidden agenda for this blog. As a group revolving almost exclusively around academia (for more [about us](./docs/about.html)) - and as such, some might say out of touch with reality - we have to write **a lot**, which can be quite hard (*cough* *read procrastination* *cough*). This blog is therefore also our attempt at significantly stepping-up our writing game!
