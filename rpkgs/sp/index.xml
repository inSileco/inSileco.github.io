      <description>When working in Ecology, it is often necessary to produce maps and calculate distances between objects such as sampled stations, species distribution ranges or geographical features. A tutorial on this blog describes many techniques to create maps with different packages in R, such as sf and raster. In this post, I will go further and use these tools to calculate distances in our spatial environment.
How to define a distance?</description>

      <title>R in Space - About spatial data</title>

      <description>Spatial data refer to phenomenon or information that can be observed geographically. What a definition! In short spatial data concern every information that could be reported on a map, i.e. on a two-dimensions geographical coordinates system. Two kinds of spatial data exist: vector data and raster data. Generally vectors refer to discrete locations, i.e. objects with boundaries (for instance a city, a road, a country) whereas raster data refer to continuous phenomenon that can be observed everywhere, but without natural boundaries (for instance the surface temperature).</description>

      <title>R in Space - Geometry manipulation</title>

      <description>To manipulate geometries, there are few options. For spatial objects defined with sp, there is a specific package to manipulate vector objects: rgeos. The equivalent of most common functions in sp are found in sf. Finally, there are a set of interesting functions in raster to handle the manipulation of rasters with vector objects.
Let’s first load the packages required and download a simple shapefile of Belgium.

      <description>Creating a thematic map In this post, we go through all the steps required to produce a complete good-looking map. We will see how to add a title, a legend, a scale, axis and a North arrow and choose a good color palette. To do so, we will use the Quebec province as our sampled area.
So, first, we import 2 vector layers readily available in R, the Canadian provincial boundaries and USA country boundary.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of spatial intersects in R</title>

      <description>Intersects &amp;amp; R We are increasingly performing spatial analyses in R. The replicability and the efficiency of programming languages is much more appealing than using user friendly softwares like ArcGIS, even though you can still code your way through analyses when using those softwares (latter versions of QGIS do a fantastic job in that regard!). The performance of tools available for spatial analyses in R is however not completely certain.</description>
