      <description>When working in Ecology, it is often necessary to produce maps and calculate distances between objects such as sampled stations, species distribution ranges or geographical features. A tutorial on this blog describes many techniques to create maps with different packages in R, such as sf and raster. In this post, I will go further and use these tools to calculate distances in our spatial environment.
How to define a distance?</description>

      <description>Online ecology Let’s imagine that we are interested in a species in a given area and wish to know as much as possible about it. But, you can’t go out in the field because funding is running short. What we do have, however, is a certain knowledge of the open data science tools that are at our disposal.</description>
