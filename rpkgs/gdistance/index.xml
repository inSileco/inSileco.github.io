      <description>When working in Ecology, it is often necessary to produce maps and calculate distances between objects such as sampled stations, species distribution ranges or geographical features.

In this post, I will go further and use these tools to calculate distances in our spatial environment.
How to define a distance? Before stepping in our topic, let&amp;rsquo;s define what we are talking about.</description>
