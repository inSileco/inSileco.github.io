      <description>Context Last week, I was discussing about how to use nls() for a specific model with one of my colleague and I ended creating a piece of code to show what I was talking about! Even though there are many posts exploring nls() in more depth that I did (for instance this post on datascienceplus by Lionel Herzog), I thought I could share these lines of command here!
Basically, we were talking about a model where the temperature (\(T\)) follows a saturation curve starting from 10°C at t=0 (so T(0) = 10) and plateauing at \(T_{\inf}\).</description>
