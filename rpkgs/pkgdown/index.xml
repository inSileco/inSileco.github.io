      <description>I have been using Travis CI (https://travis-ci.org/) since 2015 and GitHub Actions (hereafter GH Actions; https://github.com/features/actions) for over a year now1. While using these two hosted continuous integration services, I came to realize that I was spending less time troubleshooting with GH Actions than I was with Travis. For this reason, I am now setting GH Actions workflows for my new projects (mainly R and Julia projects) and slowly migrating older projects from Travis to GH Actions.</description>

      <description>Jonas Geschke, Ignasi Bartomeus and I have recently released rcites v-1.0.0 on CRAN, a R client for the Species+ API after it has been reviewed by rOpenSci. In this post, I would like to share this recent experience as well as several valuable resources.
Screenshot of the rcites&amp;rsquo; CRAN homepage What is an R package? In the introduction of his book R packages, Hadley Wickham wrote:
A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others.</description>
