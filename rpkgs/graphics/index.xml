      <description>Context If you are using R’s base graphics system for your plots and if you like customizing your plots, you may have already wondered how to custom the tick marks of your plots! I do that quite a lot and I thought it would be worth explaining how I do so. Let’s consider the following plot,
cx &amp;lt;- seq(0, 2, 0.1) cy &amp;lt;- cx + .5*rnorm(length(cx)) plot(cx, cy) By default, plot.</description>

      <description>Creating a thematic map In this post, we go through all the steps required to produce a complete good-looking map. We will see how to add a title, a legend, a scale, axis and a North arrow and choose a good color palette. To do so, we will use the Quebec province as our sampled area.
So, first, we import 2 vector layers readily available in R, the Canadian provincial boundaries and USA country boundary.</description>

      <description>Gantt charts Gantt charts are a very useful way to organize projects into milestones and tasks visually. They are also dead useful when comes the time to create a timeline for a project, whether it be for a research project, field work or grant applications. I recently wanted to create one, but was unsatisfied by what was available out there in terms of visuals (although there are neat R examples, see here, here and here).</description>

      <description>The “need” for animations 
As part of my PhD thesis, I am currently characterizing the intensity of multiple stressors in the estuary and gulf of St. Lawrence (see ResearchGate project for more details). I have recently needed (read: thought it would be cool) to create an animation of the temporal variations in ultra-violet intensity in the St. Lawrence. Here is how I did it.
