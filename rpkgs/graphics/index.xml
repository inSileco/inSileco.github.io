I do that quite a lot and I thought it would be worth explaining how I do so. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the following plot,
1 2 3 cx &amp;lt;- seq(0, 2, 0.1) cy &amp;lt;- cx + .5*rnorm(length(cx)) plot(cx, cy) By default, plot.</description>

      <description>Gantt charts Gantt charts are a very useful way to organize projects into milestones and tasks visually. They are also dead useful when comes the time to create a timeline for a project, whether it be for a research project, field work or grant applications. I recently wanted to create one, but was unsatisfied by what was available out there in terms of visuals (although there are neat R examples, see here, here and here).</description>

      <description>The “need” for animations As part of my PhD thesis, I am currently characterizing the intensity of multiple stressors in the estuary and gulf of St. Lawrence (see ResearchGate project for more details). I have recently needed (read: thought it would be cool) to create an animation of the temporal variations in ultra-violet intensity in the St. Lawrence. Here is how I did it.
