      <description>When working in Ecology, it is often necessary to produce maps and calculate distances between objects such as sampled stations, species distribution ranges or geographical features. A tutorial on this blog describes many techniques to create maps with different packages in R, such as sf and raster. In this post, I will go further and use these tools to calculate distances in our spatial environment.
How to define a distance? Before stepping in our topic, let&amp;rsquo;s define what we are talking about.</description>

      <description>Trick or Tips? Ever tumbled on a code chunk that made you say: &#34;I should have known this ¶ø?!@~&amp;* piece of code long ago!?&#34; Chances are you have, frustratingly, just like we have, and on multiple occasions too. In comes Trick or Tips! Trick or Tips is a series of blog posts that each present 5 -- hopefully helpful -- coding tips for a specific programming language. Posts should be short (i.</description>

      <description>The “need” for animations As part of my PhD thesis, I am currently characterizing the intensity of multiple stressors in the estuary and gulf of St. Lawrence (see ResearchGate project for more details). I have recently needed (read: thought it would be cool) to create an animation of the temporal variations in ultra-violet intensity in the St. Lawrence. Here is how I did it.

      <description>Online ecology Let’s imagine that we are interested in a species in a given area and wish to know as much as possible about it. But, you can’t go out in the field because funding is running short. What we do have, however, is a certain knowledge of the open data science tools that are at our disposal. In a series of post about online ecology, we will find out exactly just how far these tools allow us to delve into the ecology of the species that interest us.</description>
