      <description>My MacOS Setup Inspired by Kevin&amp;rsquo;s recent post on setting up his new laptop on Debian Stretch, I decided that it was time to reset my Mac BookPro to factory settings. I bought it after a year in my thesis and I&amp;rsquo;ve grown quite a bit since then in my understanding of programming and computers in general. That also meant that I had a lot of accumulated junk!
I also figured that I should do so using a bash script so that I could make this whole process as reproducible as possible for the next time or if I have to change my laptop for some obscure reason!</description>

      <description>R 3.5.0 &amp;ldquo;Joy in playing&amp;rdquo; was released April 23rd this year. It took a couple of weeks before it was made available on Debian testing due to the work required to rebuild the packages and as a Debian user that spend a lot of time on R, I am extremely grateful to the work of Dirk, Michael and Johannes on this!
I thought it was a good opportunity to write few notes about my R setup.</description>

      <description>For almost a year now I&amp;rsquo;ve being spending most of my computer time on Debian. I began with Debian Stretch and switched to Debian Testing two months ago. This was another good opportunity to gain skills and I&amp;rsquo;d like to report about my transition in this post.
What really happened? The hope of a seamless transition Last Easter, after a couple of months on Debian Stretch, I felt like the time had come for me to go Debian Testing.</description>

      <title>Setting my Debian Stretch up</title>

      <description>This post details my Debian Stretch setup on my Lenovo ThinkPad T470p. I got this machine in early August 2017, so I now have almost 6 months worth of experience on Debian and I thought it was a good time to 1- document the rationale behind my move from MacOS to Debian 2- explain how I set my computer up and 3- how I rate my appreciation of working on Debian.</description>
