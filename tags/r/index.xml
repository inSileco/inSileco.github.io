      <description>Context If you are using R&amp;rsquo;s base graphics system for your plots and if you like customizing your plots, you may have already wondered how to custom the tick marks of your plots! I do that quite a lot and I thought it would be worth explaining how I do so. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the following plot,
1 2 3 cx &amp;lt;- seq(0, 2, 0.1) cy &amp;lt;- cx + .5*rnorm(length(cx)) plot(cx, cy) By default, plot.</description>

      <description>In the first part of this post I introduced several functions available in the package inSilecoMisc. In this post, I keep on introducing features of the package you might find useful! If you did not read the first part of this post and are interested in reproducing the examples below, simply install inSilecoMisc:
1 2 3 # Run if package is not already installed install.packages(&amp;#34;remotes&amp;#34;) remotes::install_github(&amp;#34;inSileco/inSilecoMisc&amp;#34;) Load it:

      <description>inSilecoMisc inSilecoMisc is an R 📦 I have been maintaining for four years now. It was originally designed as a convenient way to share handy functions. Instead of stacking them in my .Rprofile, I created a package and made it available on GitHub. inSilecoMisc is therefore a set of miscellaneous functions, just as other R packages (e.g. Hmisc) but as I frequently change its API, it is meant to stay in the experimental stage!</description>

      <description>When working in Ecology, it is often necessary to produce maps and calculate distances between objects such as sampled stations, species distribution ranges or geographical features. A tutorial on this blog describes many techniques to create maps with different packages in R, such as sf and raster. In this post, I will go further and use these tools to calculate distances in our spatial environment.
How to define a distance? Before stepping in our topic, let&amp;rsquo;s define what we are talking about.</description>

      <description>Creating a data frame is fairly simple but when you need to create a large empty data frame with columns that have different classes it takes several command lines. A few days ago, I decided to write a function to simplify this operation and I came to realize that such a function would actually be very useful to ease the row binding of data frames whose column names partially match. How so?</description>

      <description>Jonas Geschke, Ignasi Bartomeus and I have recently released rcites v-1.0.0 on CRAN, a R client for the Species+ API after it has been reviewed by rOpenSci. In this post, I would like to share this recent experience as well as several valuable resources.
What is an R package? In the introduction of his book R packages, Hadley Wickham wrote:
A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others.</description>

      <description>Context Last week, I was discussing about how to use nls() for a specific model with one of my colleague and I ended creating a piece of code to show what I was talking about! Even though there are many posts exploring nls() in more depth that I did (for instance this post on datascienceplus by Lionel Herzog), I thought I could share these lines of command here!
Basically, we were talking about a model where the temperature ($T$) follows a saturation curve starting from 10°C at t=0 (so T(0) = 10) and plateauing at \(T_{\inf}\).</description>

      <description>R 3.5.0 &amp;ldquo;Joy in playing&amp;rdquo; was released April 23rd this year. It took a couple of weeks before it was made available on Debian testing due to the work required to rebuild the packages and as a Debian user that spend a lot of time on R, I am extremely grateful to the work of Dirk, Michael and Johannes on this!
I thought it was a good opportunity to write few notes about my R setup.</description>

      <description>I (Kevin) recently rebuilt my personal website and I was eager to set up the same workflow Steve built for our blog (this blog!), i.e. a combination of Hugo, Github and Travis. I though this was a good opportunity to detail how it works and so I wrote this post with Steve. Note that there are several blog posts on the topic available online, for instance here and here. We did our best to complement them in the following post.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a very interesting paper from Laura Dee and collaborators focused on the concept of metanetworks and entitled &amp;ldquo;Operationalizing Network Theory for Ecosystem Service Assessments&amp;rdquo; (Dee et al 2017, TREE 32(2):118-130). After reading that article I have begun to revamp the context of my thesis around the concept of metanetworks to include environmental impact assessment and cumulative impacts assessment within such a framework.
Work extensively with networks, you quickly realize that coming up with meaningful and useful visualization can be a bit of a challenge.</description>

      <description>Gantt charts Gantt charts are a very useful way to organize projects into milestones and tasks visually. They are also dead useful when comes the time to create a timeline for a project, whether it be for a research project, field work or grant applications. I recently wanted to create one, but was unsatisfied by what was available out there in terms of visuals (although there are neat R examples, see here, here and here).</description>

      <description>Intersects &amp;amp; R We are increasingly performing spatial analyses in R. The replicability and the efficiency of programming languages is much more appealing than using pieces of user friendly software like ArcGIS, even though you can still code your way through analyses when using them (latter versions of QGIS do a fantastic job in that regard!). The performance of tools available for spatial analyses in R is however not completely certain.</description>

      <description>The “need” for animations As part of my PhD thesis, I am currently characterizing the intensity of multiple stressors in the estuary and gulf of St. Lawrence (see ResearchGate project for more details). I have recently needed (read: thought it would be cool) to create an animation of the temporal variations in ultra-violet intensity in the St. Lawrence. Here is how I did it.

      <description>Online ecology Let’s imagine that we are interested in a species in a given area and wish to know as much as possible about it. But, you can’t go out in the field because funding is running short. What we do have, however, is a certain knowledge of the open data science tools that are at our disposal. In a series of post about online ecology, we will find out exactly just how far these tools allow us to delve into the ecology of the species that interest us.</description>

We all know how to go at the top or the bottom of a website clicking on chevrons ( ). We are also familiar with simple symbols that allow us to click and edit the text we are typing ( ). Moreover, some web applications are so widespread than their logo appears in thousands of websites (i.</description>

Why use R to produce graphics? S, R’s ancestor, was first designed to be an interactive interface for calling routines from the SCS (Statistical Computing Subroutines) FORTRAN library. It expanded to be a complete programming language dedicated to data manipulation, statistical analysis and data visualization (see A brief History of S).</description>
