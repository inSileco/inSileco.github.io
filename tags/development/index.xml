      <description>In the first part of this post I introduced several functions available in the package inSilecoMisc. In this post, I keep on introducing features of the package you might find useful! If you did not read the first part of this post and are interested in reproducing the examples below, simply install inSilecoMisc:
# Run if package is not already installed install.packages(&amp;quot;remotes&amp;quot;) remotes::install_github(&amp;quot;inSileco/inSilecoMisc&amp;quot;) Load it:
library(&amp;quot;inSilecoMisc&amp;quot;) packageVersion(&amp;quot;inSilecoMisc&amp;quot;) #R&amp;gt; [1] &amp;#39;0.</description>

      <description>inSilecoMisc inSilecoMisc is an R ðŸ“¦ I have been maintaining for four years now. It was originally designed as a convenient way to share handy functions. Instead of stacking them in my .Rprofile, I created a package and made it available on GitHub. inSilecoMisc is therefore a set of miscellaneous functions, just as other R packages (e.g. Hmisc) but as I frequently change its API, it is meant to stay in the experimental stage!</description>

      <description>Jonas Geschke, Ignasi Bartomeus and I have recently released rcites v-1.0.0 on CRAN, a R client for the Species+ API after it has been reviewed by rOpenSci. In this post, I would like to share this recent experience as well as several valuable resources.
     What is an R package? In the introduction of his book R packages, Hadley Wickham wrote:
 A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others.</description>
