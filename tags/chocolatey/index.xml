      <description>Long story short, I recently had access to a Dell Studio XPS 8100 with Windows 7 on it. I was told that the computer was not working well and so was allowed to tweak it. The computer was actually working well, so I simply decided to add a partition Ubuntu.
Ubuntu is based on Debian and arguably more beginner-friendly than the latter. Roughly speaking:
