      <description>My MacOS Setup Inspired by Kevin&amp;rsquo;s recent post on setting up his new laptop on Debian Stretch, I decided that it was time to reset my Mac BookPro to factory settings. I bought it after a year in my thesis and I&amp;rsquo;ve grown quite a bit since then in my understanding of programming and computers in general. That also meant that I had a lot of accumulated junk!
I also figured that I should do so using a bash script so that I could make this whole process as reproducible as possible for the next time or if I have to change my laptop for some obscure reason!</description>
