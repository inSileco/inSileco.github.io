      <description>Long story short, I recently had access to a Dell Studio XPS 8100  with Windows 7 on it. I was told that the computer was not working well and so was allowed to tweak it. The computer was actually working well, so I simply decided to add a partition Ubuntu.
Ubuntu is based on Debian and arguably more beginner-friendly than the latter. Roughly speaking:
Ubuntu = Debian Testing + software to simplify its use There are a couple of articles online that are opposing these two Linux distributions, which makes no real sense to me.</description>
