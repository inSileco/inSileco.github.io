      <description>Intersects &amp;amp; R We are increasingly performing spatial analyses in R. The replicability and the efficiency of programming languages is much more appealing than using user friendly softwares like ArcGIS, even though you can still code your way through analyses when using those softwares (latter versions of QGIS do a fantastic job in that regard!). The performance of tools available for spatial analyses in R is however not completely certain.</description>
