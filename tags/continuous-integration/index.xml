      <description>I have been using Travis CI (https://travis-ci.org/) since 2015 and GitHub Actions (hereafter GH Actions; https://github.com/features/actions) for over a year now1. While using these two hosted continuous integration services, I came to realize that I was spending less time troubleshooting with GH Actions than I was with Travis. For this reason, I am now setting GH Actions workflows for my new projects (mainly R and Julia projects) and slowly migrating older projects from Travis to GH Actions.</description>
