      <description>The mapping landscape has changed! Over the last decade it has become increasingly easy to create and edit maps. As explained by Mark Zastrow in “Science on the Map&amp;rdquo;, the mapping landscape has dramatically changed over the last decade. Scientists can now readily draw valuable spatial representations of their work, even with large data sets and perform powerful analyses using specific packages of programming languages such as R and Python. In order to give you a taste of the diversity of tool to manipulate, analyze and visualize geographic information, we listed a few software available:</description>

      <description>The Internet… what an amazing network! So many websites, so many resources, how easy it is to get lost when navigating the vast digital ocean! Teaching how to identify credible online material is doubtlessly one of the biggest educational challenge of our time. As researchers with strong interests in computational methods in ecology, we spend a substantial amount of our time searching various kind of information online ranging from a small piece of code to massive ecological database.</description>

      <description>Note that the list of packages below would be updated as soon as we find a new package. If you know a package that should be in the list, please feel mention it in the disqus section below.

Why use R to produce graphics? S, R’s ancestor, was first designed to be an interactive interface for calling routines from the SCS (Statistical Computing Subroutines) FORTRAN library. It expanded to be a complete programming language dedicated to data manipulation, statistical analysis and data visualization (see A brief History of S).</description>
