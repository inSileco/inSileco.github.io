  project: "The intensification of the human footprint in marine ecosystems imposes the use of a systematic planning approach for the use of marine resources. There is, however, currently little knowledge on how multiple stressors interact to affect the integrity of ecosystem structure and functions. My PhD project focuses on evaluating cumulative anthropogenic impacts on the structure of the communities of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada.
The specific goals of my thesis are to:
1. Evaluate cumulative impacts on the ecosystems of the St. Lawrence,
2. Characterize the spatial structure of the communities of the St. Lawrence,
3. Evaluate the vulnerability of biological communities to multiple stressors, and
4. Evaluate cumulative impacts on the communities of the St. Lawrence from the cartography of stressors (Obj. 1) and communities (Obj. 2), as well as the vulnerability of communities to multiple stressors (Obj 3)."

  project: "Biogegraphy aims at unravelling the causes of species geographic
  repartitions and including them in an integrativ theory. Species interact in
  many ways and these biotic interactions affect their demographic variables.
  Therefore, just as abiotic variables do, interactions should impact the
  probability of being present in a particuliar, i.e. species interactions are
  likely a key factor to understand species distribution. In order to better
  grasp how interactions affect species repartitiion:
  I 1- develop theoretical frameworks to genereate new hypotheses which I
  2- test by analysis large ecological datasets."

  project: "It is well known that climate change will modify the distribution of trees over the coming decades and many studies have already showed responses for some species. However, the potential of forest management to mitigate climate change impacts on forest dynamics remains poorly understood. The overall goal of my PhD is to develop a decision-make tool to improve management strategies that take climate change into account. I will build a model that represents forest dynamics at different spatial and temporal scales, and the effect of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. The model will be parametrized from a forest inventory database and we will focus on tracking uncertainty using Bayesian methods. By quantifying trees migration rate under climate change in different forest management scenarios, we expect to find a positive effect of forest management on accelerating forest migration towards the north. In addition, we expect a better understanding of the synergetic interactions between human actions and forest dynamics."

  project: "Human activities induce multiple stressors that organisms have to
  cope with in their natural habitats. However, monitoring global change
  effects is often investigated independently without accounting for potential
  synergy among them. The aim of my PhD is to disentangle the relative influence
  of habitat degradation (agricultural intensification, urban sprawl) and
  pollution on the breeding performance of three cavity nesting birds. Up to
  600 nest boxes spread across an urban-rural gradient in the Lower
  Saint-Laurent area are monitored annually since 2014 through a citizen
  science program. Passive atmospheric samplers were deployed along this
  gradient to map the contaminants. Our objectives are to compare nest
  occupancy, breeding performance (phenology, clutch size, growth rate) and
  physiological performance (metabolic rates, stress levels) of birds in
  different physical and chemical habitats. Several experimental studies will
  further demonstrate the relative impact of pesticide exposure and chronic or
  acute stress on nestlings’ development and energetic performance in these
  common birds."
