# How to contribute

We love contributions!

Everyone is welcome to contribute. There are two main ways to contribute:

- report an issue
- propose a new post


## Pull Requests

## Issues

Opening new issues is a very useful way to start a discussion about bugs (obviously) but also to discuss new features, new posts, new series of post. We strongly encourage the authors that come up with a new idea to open a new issue so we can discuss it. Once the issue is solved, it should be closed (obviously) and if the issue is address via a new commit then we encourage to [close it via commit message](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/).
