## Who can write a blogpost?

All members of the `inSileco` team. However an extra step is required: a member
must first fill out a separate `yaml` file in the `data/authors/` folder
to provide some details about himself/herself. The easiest way to proceed is to
copy/paste one existing file of this kind (see below) and to replace the information.
For the sake of clarity, below is what the `data/authors/kevin.yaml` looks like:

```yaml
given_name: Kevin
family_name: Cazelles
description: "Post-doctoral fellow"
project: "What am I doing"
github: KevCaz
twitter: KCazelles
researchgate: Kevin_Cazelles
website: yourwebsite
orcid: 0000-0001-6619-9874
impactstory: 0000-0001-6619-9874
publons: publons_id
gscholar: https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=xzvcu7cAAAAJ&hl=fr
```

Note that avatars are retrieved from Github accounts. Also, names of these files
can be used as a shortcut to add author's info on posts, so keep them short and
simple.


## How to use Github to publish a post?

The default branch is the `dev` branch, the master branch is where the public
version of the website is stored. The deployment of the website from the `dev`
branch to the `master` branch is handled by Travis (see `.travis.yml` and the
travis settings for more information).

For substantial changes in the features of the website we strongly encourage to
create a new branch and create a pull request to add the desired features.
Depending on your skills you may benefit from a review. Creating a new branch
is also encouraged for new posts.


## Writing a new post

See wiki


## Issues

Opening new issues is a very useful way to start a discussion about bugs (obviously) but also to discuss new features, new posts, new series of post. We strongly encourage the authors that come up with a new idea to open a new issue so we can discuss it. Once the issue is solved, it should be closed (obviously) and if the issue is address via a new commit then we encourage to [close it via commit message](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/).
