  abstract	= {This address treats some enduring misconceptions about
		  modeling. One of these is that the goal is always
		  prediction. The lecture distinguishes between explanation
		  and prediction as modeling goals, and offers sixteen
		  reasons other than prediction to build a model. It also
		  challenges the common assumption that scientific theories
		  arise from and 'summarize' data, when often, theories
		  precede and guide data collection; without theory, in other
		  words, it is not clear what data to collect. Among other
		  things, it also argues that the modeling enterprise
		  enforces habits of mind essential to freedom. It is based
		  on the author's 2008 Bastille Day keynote address to the
		  Second World Congress on Social Simulation, George Mason
		  University, and earlier addresses at the Institute of
		  Medicine, the University of Michigan, and the Santa Fe
		  Institute.}
