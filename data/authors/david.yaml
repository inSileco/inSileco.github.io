project: "The intensification of the human footprint in marine ecosystems imposes the use of a systematic planning approach for the use of marine resources. There is, however, currently little knowledge on how multiple stressors interact to affect the integrity of ecosystem structure and functions. My PhD project focuses on evaluating cumulative anthropogenic impacts on the structure of the communities of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada.
The specific goals of my thesis are to:
  1. Evaluate cumulative impacts on the ecosystems of the St. Lawrence,
  2. Characterize the spatial structure of the communities of the St. Lawrence,
  3. Evaluate the vulnerability of biological communities to multiple stressors, and
  4. Evaluate cumulative impacts on the communities of the St. Lawrence from the cartography of stressors (Obj. 1) and communities (Obj. 2), as well as the vulnerability of communities to multiple stressors (Obj 3)."
