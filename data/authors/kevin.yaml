project: "Biogegraphy aims at unravelling the causes of species geographic
repartitions and including them in an integrativ theory. Species interact in
many ways and these biotic interactions affect their demographic variables.
Therefore, just as abiotic variables do, interactions should impact the
probability of being present in a particuliar, i.e. species interactions are
likely a key factor to understand species distribution. In order to better
grasp how interactions affect species repartitiion:
I 1- develop theoretical frameworks to genereate new hypotheses which I
2- test by analysis large ecological datasets."
