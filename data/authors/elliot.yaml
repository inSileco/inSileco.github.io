description: "PhD student at [UQAR/ISMER](http://www.ismer.ca)"
project: "The goal of my PhD is to describe and characterise individual and cumulative impacts of human activities on the benthic ecosystems, at a fine spatial scale (0,01 km2).
The sampled sites are located near Sept-Iles (QC), where different human activities occur at the same place. In the end, we will develop stress-maps for the impacts of these activities on the endobenthic communities, along with indicators of ecosystem health in regard to cumulative impacts at local spatial scales."
