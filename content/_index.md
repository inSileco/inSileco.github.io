### Welcome :wave:

---

The overarching goal of this blog is quite straightforward: tackle challenges and opportunities provided by this new era of open-access and computationally intensive research in the field of ecology. You will therefore find a collection of blog posts that reflect this: code snippets, ecological insights, new and exciting computational tools, opinions on various field of ecology and programming, etc.

In the interest of full disclosure, we also have a hidden agenda for this blog. As a group revolving almost exclusively around academia (for more [about us](/about/)) - and as such, some might say out of touch with reality - we have to write **a lot**, which can be quite hard (*cough* *read procrastination* *cough*). This blog is therefore also our attempt at significantly stepping-up our writing game!
