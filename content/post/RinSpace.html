<h1>So it begins</h1>
<p>A good proportion of people involved in inSileco have one particular expertise
in common: we deal with spatial data. This expertise has been developed through
extensive time importing, creating and formatting spatial data, performing
spatial analyses and building static and dynamic visualization of spatial
objects.</p>
<p>In this blog post series, we propose an educational tour of spatial possibilities
offered by tools developed in the R environment. This series could thus be used
in an educational setting to learn how to use R with R objects.</p>
<p>As is our usual habit, rather than creating a series of posts presenting specific
tools, we will first ask a series of explicitly spatial and ecological questions
and go through the possibilities offered by R to play around with spatial tools.</p>
