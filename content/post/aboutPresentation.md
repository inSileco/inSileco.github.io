This summer, I went to two conferences:
[Canadian Society for Ecology & Evolution Meeting 2018](http://www.csee2018.ca/)
(hosted by the university where I am currently working at!) and the
[Ecological Society of America Meeting 2018](https://esa.org/neworleans/) and
gave a talk during both of them. As I attended dozens of talks, I spent some
time thinking about what makes a talk good talk (read "a talk I like") and what
stop focusing on what the speaker is telling. In what follows, I've tried to
organize my thoughts around a couple of principles that are my own opinion.
I do think there are a set of good advice but some people may or may not agree
to all of then. I start with general thoughts that applies on communication
at large and finish with few hints!
What follows is base on my experience and subjective I did not learn much
from communication I simply think about it and try to improve the way
I present stuff talk after talk.


## 1. Communication is what we do

There are two things a scientist do: science and communicating about science.
For the latter,
There are many ways of communicating science: teaching, publishing an article in a
peer-reviewed journal, giving a talk or a poster in a conference, writing
a blog post, even [tweeting frequently could be a strong asset for scientific outreach](http://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10.1139/facets-2018-0002). Each of
them comes with their specific constrains: 20 minutes for a contributed talk
at the ESA, 280 words per tweet; and a require a specific set of skills: writing a
scientific paper, creating a poster. Mastering several communication is at the
core of the job of a scientific although it is quite hard and some of us are
not properly trained to do so.

As any communication system, communicating your science involves a transmitter
that sent a message through a (noisy) channel to a receiver. In the specific
case of a scientific given a talk that is explaining is research, he/she is the transmitter
of a message he/she created and it he sending to an audience.
For a t The message is a combinatio

So it's a combination between a set of slides and a discourse about it
you are prononcing. So below I'll give set of general advice but
agian is the combination. Also use your asset good visual, good speaker
and work your drawbacks!
A discoureses about our research with a certain angle / natrrated report
of your research make it a nice story!

Muti fold poster / talk are two main but twitter a blog discussing αwebsite are other
Muti forma and multiple challenge to associte. Here


Although it is one of the many tasks we are doing as researcher, communication
is one of the most important one. Funny think is that we often forgoet about
it and sometime do not give communication the place ot deserves.
We should be aware that communication is  important if we do nice
discover but never tell anybody, why having work in the wfirst place?





It is outreach

It takes time to do a good pres or a poster, so it does matter to ask yourself
why and how much it os actually worth spendung on it. What do you want
show that you doing great stuff, getting feed back, you do not understand
you results and what a possible explantion. One people can make fantastic input
try to get the best out of it, so take some time!

Who's suport to do the pedagy effirm, you! If they are digesting well
it's not your fault but they have to understand. A talk is not a show
well you are try to show that you've worked hard, the paper do that,
you are here ..

Also take home is good but I really think that we should a bit more than that
why / how  at least otherwise we shoudl do a simple speed talk with it.
not worth soengng hours ion your take for three sentences,

"I'd happy to discuss the results after the session"



## 3. Identify the kind of talk you'll give

### How long?

- time: speed talk (<10), regular 10-30 (10 shory and 30 symoisio clot), seminar >30 min
First restrinciton Here I no teaching you are presenting your research

here 10-15 I'd say 20-30 allow you to do the same for two related topic (2 related
  project) or to unpack 1.

20 minutes included questions reads 15min, letting people some tie for question
is importnat,

### Audience

- audience: neophyte non biologist, specialist ultra speciealist basically
the one that try to publish paper on the same topic bo=efor you

ESA/CSEE only ecologists but eventhough at your talk there are specialist of
your topic there ar still quite generalist so gove a context for ecologist
that start low finish high!


### What kind of support?

- support: slide or blackborad, poster (in a way poster good be seen as a speed talk
  with a specific suport)

As commom is it at least for biologist and 12-15 with slides.

Why we are going to a conference

What are elements of the slides photos drawing ytetx photod texte

A last word about the format among the most beautifyl presentation
many were not done weith ppt... doies mean that but odt or pdf (support)
is the least one can do.. HTML give a powerful +, time to embrace is.. Support ppt html pdf
constrain


### What is the main message?

- goal: review, new idea, new dirsction of research, promoting a paper, anoncing new resyults, tutorial?

reuirqemnt some time conference are explicit about the fact that they want new
results in crontirbuted talk, play the game!









## 4- Consistency is the key

Same words, same set of tons
Same font police same set of colors, shaoe
consitency is a real asset for aesthtic, I mean it's easy to gve the feeling of
haomony with this. Is it way more complicated with irregular shape a color
used any way,

Advice use color


## 5- A matter of dosage and rhythm

Pace calm / enthousiast to me people a bit cocky or too detached does
not work. reciting unless you know to act..
Info/slides
I've seen a 12 minutes talks with about 100 plots, slides with 10 plots and
4 information. So bacially I stop lessing a started counting them.

What do you want to say, just copy past resulst so they see that you've worked
if they are published, well juste copy paste the paper on one slide and
discuss how the audience can access the paper!

rhytm ton to get the attention, you want to drag the audience you want them
to lesson to you,


1 info per plot

The little time, do not comment comment a outline...

Text per slide reassuring,,, non comment you have to let them have the time to read
ι
the less text the better but you do not want to lose any body so some clera sentence
helps s

"you don' need to pay to much attention to this" A talk is a curration, it should not have made it.



## 6- Be Serious not boring

It's not all about jokes neither, It's about a nice stroy
well told, with enthousian and hope for future research,  
image it does not prevent jokes or .. 





## 7- A pedagogical challenge

spend spend time in results
animation for pedagogic resuts  is often
results one

"on the x axis we have" explian the plot

Figure of a publication rarely fits, the reader have all time.


"talk to your audience "



non native speaker do not appologize for your accent do your best try
to imporove the prononciation (english pronounciation is complicated)
Most of our colleague understande that it is harder for us as we as to
do our job in a foreign langage. + prononciation indian, UK, New-Zeland
US. Worst case scenario make fun of your accent, and you know what,
it's not as bad as it sounds!
