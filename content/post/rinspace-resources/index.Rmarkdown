## The mapping landscape has chnaged!

Over the last decade it has become increasingly easy to create and edit maps.
As explained by Mark Zastrow in [â€œScience on the Map"](http://www.nature.com/news/data-visualization-science-on-the-map-1.17024),
the mapping landscape has dramatically changed over the last decade.
Scientists can now readily draw valuable spatial representations
of their work, even with large data sets and perform powerful analyses
using specific packages of programming languages such as R and Python.
In order to give you a taste of the diversity of tool to manipulate,
analyze and visualize geographic information, we listed a few software
available:


### Geographic Information System (GIS)

- [Quantum GIS](http://qgis.org/en/site/);
- [ArcGIS](http://www.arcgis.com/features/);
- [DIVA-GIS](http://www.diva-gis.org);
- [GRASS GIS](http://grass.osgeo.org);
- [PostGIS](http://www.postgis.org);
- [SAGA GIS](http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html).

### Web mapping tools  

- [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com);
- [GeoJson](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0);
- [Google Map](https://www.google.fr/maps);
- [Goole Earth](http://www.google.fr/intl/eng/earth/index.html);
- [OpenStreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/);
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).



### Specific packages of various programming languages

#### C/C++ libraries:

- [proj4](http://proj4.org/);
- [gdal](http://www.gdal.org/index.html);
- [geos](https://trac.osgeo.org/geosc).

#### JavaScript:

- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com)
- [Turf](http://turfjs.org/)
- more information [here](https://codepen.io/stevepepple/post/javascript-geospatial-examples)

#### Julia packages

- [JuliaGeo](https://github.com/JuliaGeo).

#### Python packages

- [cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/);
- [geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy);
- more information [here](http://geopandas.org/).

#### R packages

- [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp);
- [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf);
- [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster);
- more information [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) and [here](http://rspatial.org/).

## So... why use R for mapping?

Given the number of tools dedicated to visualization and analyses of spatial
data, it is important that users ask this question and take some time to balance
pros and cons of using R for mapping. According to us, the choice strongly
relies on:

1. your ambition in terms of mapping;
2. your skills in R.

If you aim at creating a good-looking map without analysis and you are not
familiar with R, it does not make sense to use R only for mapping. But if
you are familiar with R or plan on becoming familiar with it to perform and
replicate spatial analyses in R, you can quickly get a good-looking map (a R
plot basically) and then benefit from the plot system you already know. Also,
when you need tricky spatial analysis, even if you are not familiar with R,
you will doubtlessly may benefit from learning it.
