## Data visualization in R

We do love creating plots with R and we think R offers a fantastic set of tools
to make beautiful graphics. Many websites and blog posts show what you can
be capable with R. Have a look at what [Gaston Sanchez created](http://www.gastonsanchez.com/Rtist/)
and [The R graph Gallery developed by Yan Holtz](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/).
The power is even more with all the package that take advantage from the JS
libraries, for instance [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/), [DiagrammR](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/), [NetworkD3](https://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/), [Wordcloud2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wordcloud2/vignettes/wordcloud.html), etc.


There are many ways to create graphics [see our wiki page
on this topic](/content/post/Rgraphpkgs.html). Some prefer to use base plots
some other prefer to use ggplot and in some context it could be very valuable to
use interactive plot such the one that can be drawn with packages that actually
turn your R code into a JS code.

Setting apart web-based graphics, core graphics feature is two fold:
the `grid` system and the `graphics` system, both are core packages. We took
the image below from [Paul Murrell's paper presenting](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2015/RJ-2015-012/index.html)
a package making the a partial conversion from the two core package.

To illustrate how to start a plot from the scratch and ready to be further customized we will
produce an empty plot with ten points whose coordinates will be `(0:10, 0:10)`.


## `graphics`-based plots

We think that when using `graphics` the need for emptying your plot is strong if
you intend at creating a empty plot. When using graphics you cannot refresh the
viewer and update it unless you re-execute all the lines. Therefore to cutomize
easer if you start with and emply plot

```{r}
plot(0:10, 0:10)
```

To empty it

```{r}
plot(0:10, 0:10)
```

if you have a careful look at the code behind `plot.default()` (the one we
actually call here) you will concclure



## `grid`-based plots

It is less clear what you should do when you are using

https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2015/RJ-2015-012/index.html



Before starting a plot actually to customized, remove everything you need...

easy to make your own function

from that to that easier to add something rather that fixing everything and when extremely customized see explicitely what desired.

So...
Let's use a basic plot
and wrote every single peace of code we need.


Note we also made a function for that available here ...

It could be a bit different


There are various way of doing an emply plot, If you google empty plot and
R you should end uo in Stack over flower with different answers that are actually all good√©  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4785657/r-how-to-draw-an-empty-plot

Let's review some of them

plot.new()

pushViewport(vp)
grid.rect(gp=gpar(fill="grey"))


This is something I used a lot to start a new plot but also I like using
here is the duncion I used.

in my package


<!-- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_blank() + theme_void() -->


<!-- ggplot() + geom_area (data=economics, aes(x = date, y = unemploy), linetype=0) +
  scale_x_date(expand = c(0,0)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
 theme_void()
 -->


We mostly often do `graphics`-based plots and so we often do the same combination.
Therefore, we created a function `plot0()` in our package `graphicsutils` available
on [<i class = "fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/inSileco/graphicsutils). We add few extra parameters make it easier.

```r
install_github("inSileco/graphicsutils")
```


```{r}
library(graphicsutils)
plot0(c(0,10))
points(1:9, 1:9)
```

```{r}
plot0(c(0,10), fill='#ebebeb', grid.col = 'white')
points(1:9, 1:9)
```
