<div id="why-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Why models?</h2>
<p>We are all modelers, and so since a long time. The first drawings you did as a
child, whether it was a cloud, your house or members of your family, were
models. Similarly, if you imagine the outcome of a war, an epidemic, a migration
crisis, you are running an implicit model.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/computing-and-ict/models-and-modelling/content-section-2.1">a model is an abstraction of the reality</a>, that allows people to focus on
the essentials by keeping out non-essential details. As Levin said in 1992<span class="citation"><sup>1</sup></span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good model does not attempt to reproduce every detail of the biological
system (…) The objective of a model should be to ask how much detail can be
ignored without producing results that contradict specific sets of observations,
on particular scales of interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or simply:</p>

<p>Hence, as George E. P. Box, famously said in 1976, “All models are wrong but
some are useful”<span class="citation"><sup>2</sup></span>. Indeed, models are useful and, thus, are widely used.
They are pervasive in biology. For instance, in 2001, out of 231 articles published
in the journal <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19399170">Ecology</a>,
100% of them used a mathematical model, in the broadest sense (including
statistical or phylogenetic analyses with a mathematical basis). Models can be
used for many different reasons. When people think about why building models,
the common answer is “to make predictions”. However, models can also be useful
to explain, to guide data collection, to raise new questions, to train
practitioners<span class="citation"><sup>3</sup></span>… (more <a href="http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/11/4/12.html">here</a>).</p>

<div id="classification" class="section level2">
<h2>Classification</h2>
<p>Mathematical models may take different forms to achieve different objectives.
It is a general term to describe the use of equations to solve or understand a
problem. The first type of mathematical models one would think of are
<strong>statistical models</strong> that, based on a probabilistic thinking, use data to
describe or predict a process. Other forms of mathematical models, often
called <strong>dynamical models</strong>, are used to study the dynamic of a process. They
can be expressed by differential or integral equations. A more complete
discussion on the differences between statistical and dynamical models can be found <a href="http://sherrytowers.com/2013/08/03/module-ii-the-difference-between-mathematical-and-statistical-modelling-plus-some-more-basics-of-r/">here</a>. In this first series of posts on
<a href="tagLink">models in ecology</a>, we will stay simple and focus on differential equations.
Also for a thoroough introduction of mathematical models in ecology we recommend
the <em>A biologist’s guide to mathematical modeling in ecology and evolution</em> by
Otto, S. P., and T. Day<span class="citation"><sup>4</sup></span>.</p>
