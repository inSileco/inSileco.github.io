## So it begins

A good proportion of people involved in inSileco have one particular expertise
in common: we work extensively with spatial data. This expertise has been
developed through extensive time importing, creating and formatting spatial
data, performing spatial analyses and building static and dynamic spatial
visualizations.

In this blog post series, we propose an educational tour of spatial possibilities
offered by tools developed in the R environment. This series could thus be used
in an educational setting to learn how to use R in Space!

<!-- The format of the posts will be quite straightforward: each post will begin with
*Post in Brief* section presenting the main functionalities presented in the post,
followed by a *Post in Details* section that goes more in depth for people who may
be more interested in an in-depth understanding of functionalities presented.

Comment DB: I don't know whether that is a realistic wish because I doubt it would be
applicable to all posts
-->

As is our usual habit, rather than creating a series of posts presenting specific
tools, we will first ask a series of explicitly spatial and ecological questions
and go through the possibilities offered by R to play around with spatial tools.

We mus mention Quebec Ocean ...

### Basic

- Useful resources: list valuable resources [:point_right:]({{< ref "rinspace-resources" >}})


### Advanced



- R in Space
  - **Resources**
    - Main spatial packages
      - `rgeos`
      - `rgdal`
      - `raster`
      - `sp`
      - `sf`
    - Other packages
      - `maptools`
      - ...
    - Spatial data in R
      - `raster`
      - `sdmpredictors`
      - ...
  - **Beginnings**
    - Spatial object in R
      - `raster`
      - `sp`
      - `sf`
      - `netcdf`? <!-- David w/ NASA data -->
    - Spatial projections
      - Resources (http://spatialreference.org/)
    - Importing spatial objects
      - Shapefiles
      - Geodatabases
      - Coordinates (see creating spatial objects) <!-- need to mention it in importing, but it really should be in creating spatial objects using coordinates data -->
    - Creating spatial objects
      - From coordinates
    - Transforming spatial objects between types
      - `sp` to `sf`
      - `sf` to `sp`
  - **Teens**
    - Spatial modifications...
