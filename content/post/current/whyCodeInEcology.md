# Why Code?

We recently stumbled on this very interesting post by
[Brandon Morelli](https://codeburst.io/the-2018-web-developer-roadmap-826b1b806e8d)
titled *The 2018 Web Developer Roadmap*.
While we are getting pretty savyy with computer skills as a group, one of our
members reaction - whose anonymity we will protect - was the following:

:smirk:
:worried:
:anguished:
<!-- -->
:flushed:
:scream:
:sob:
:angry:
:rage:
:triumph:
:neutral_face:
<!-- -->
:relieved:

<!-- No need to explain that he wasnâ€™t thrilled. -->

The reality is that we are not programmers, we have no formal education in
computer science and we learn what we do mostly on our own. But why do we do
this and why do we profoundly believe that the computer skills we are developing
are crucial in our era of ecological science?
