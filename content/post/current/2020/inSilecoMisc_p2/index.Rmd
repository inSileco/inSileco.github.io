Part 2 see part 1 (link)

remotes::install_github("inSileco/inSilecoMisc")
```

```{R}
library("inSilecoMisc")
packageVersion("inSilecoMisc")
```




## `scaleWithin()`

This functions is meant to ease the creation of scale ().


```{R}
val <- runif(50, 0, 100)
scaleWithin(val, 20, 20, 80)
```



## Messages

Not essential but very useful to see what happening that is why I like
package such as [`cli`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cli) and [`crayon`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=crayon)

It is somewhat convenient to have standardized messages when u

```{R, results = "hold"}
msgInfo("computing")
msgSuccess("done")
msgError("you got it wrong")
msgWarning("be careful")
```


## New feature `tblDown()`

This is something . Of course if you are using R Markdown but if your are not
if a couple of manipulations. `tblDown()` makes it very easy.
