## Context

If you are using R's base graphics system for your plots and if you like
customizing your plots, you may have already wondered how to custom the tick
marks of your plots! I do that quite a lot and I thought it would be worth
explaining how I do so. Let's consider the following plot,

```{R prob}
cx <- seq(0, 2, 0.1)
cy <- cx + .5*rnorm(length(cx))
plot(cx, cy)
```

By default, `plot.default` internally has its way to decide where tick marks
should be added. It is always a good default choice, but sometimes not the one
you're looking for. Fortunately, the core package `graphics` includes all what
you need to custom the tick marks and so, without further ado, let's custom our
ticks!


## Remove axes and add them back

The first step is to remove all axes. This basically requires to set `axes` to
`FALSE` in `plot()`:

```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
```

Then I add the axes back, for the moment, let's just add the y-axis back without
any change

```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
```

Then, let's add the 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 to the x-axis:


```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5))
```

I can easily change the labels if values on the axis are not the ones that
should be displayed, e.g.

```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5), labels = letters[1:5])
```



## Second set of tick marks

Now, let's add a second set tick marks! This can be done by calling `axis()` one
more time.

```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5))
axis(1, at = setdiff(cx, seq(0, 2, .5)), labels = NA)
```

As you may have noticed, I use `setdiff()` to select the complementary set of
ticks. I think it is an efficient of proceeding: I first select the finest gap
between two ticks (here 0.1) and create the sequence with `seq()`, then create
the main set of tick marks and finally use `setdiff()` will to add the
remaining tick marks. Also here, as I don't want to add extra labels, I just set
the labels to `NA`.

Now, before tweaking the visual aspect of the ticks, let's add the box.


```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5), labels = seq(0, 2, .5))
axis(1, at = setdiff(cx, seq(0, 2, .5)), labels = NA)
box()
```

By the way, you can change its visual aspect pretty easily, e.g.

```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5), labels = seq(0, 2, .5))
axis(1, at = setdiff(cx, seq(0, 2, .5)), labels = NA)
box(bty = "l")
```


## Remove the extra line

The main reason why I adjust the tick marks on my plots is because `axis()` and
`box()` add lines that partially overlap (this is also true when you use the
default behavior of `plot()`): the lines that comes along with the ticks

```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5), labels = seq(0, 2, .5))
axis(1, at = setdiff(cx, seq(0, 2, .5)), labels = NA)
```

overlap with the box

```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
box()
```

This may frequently goes unnoticed, but I tend to notice such overlap this and
it annoys me... Anyway, one way to handle this is to set the line width to 0 in
`axis()`.


```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5), labels = seq(0, 2, .5), lwd = 0)
axis(1, at = setdiff(cx, seq(0, 2, .5)), labels = NA, lwd = 0)
```

and then to set the line with of the ticks, controlled by `lwd.ticks`, to
something greater than 0

```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5), labels = seq(0, 2, .5), lwd = 0, lwd.ticks = 1)
axis(1, at = setdiff(cx, seq(0, 2, .5)), labels = NA, lwd = NA, lwd.ticks = 1)
box()
```

Note that if you only wish to remove the marks you can use `tick = FALSE`.

```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5), labels = seq(0, 2, .5), tick = FALSE)
axis(1, at = setdiff(cx, seq(0, 2, .5)), labels = NA, tick = FALSE)
box()
```

But if you just want to get rid of the extra line, but not the ticks, then you
need set `lwd` to 0 and `lwd.ticks` to a positive values.



## Custom the ticks

Having done the steps above, you may have realized that fine-tuning `lwd.ticks`
is a good way to custom your tick marks!

```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5), labels = seq(0, 2, .5), lwd = 0, lwd.ticks = 1.5)
axis(1, at = setdiff(cx, seq(0, 2, .5)), labels = NA, lwd = 0, lwd.ticks = .5)
box()
```

A second parameter to further customize the tick marks is `tck`, which allows
you to adjust the length of tick marks. To read the documentation of this
parameter, you need to check the documentation of `par()`, but you can pass it
directly to `axis()`.


```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5), labels = seq(0, 2, .5), lwd = 0, tck = -0.07,
  lwd.ticks = 1)
axis(1, at = setdiff(cx, seq(0, 2, .5)), labels = NA, lwd.ticks = 1)
box()
```



Moreover, using positive value you can make the tick go up!

```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5), labels = seq(0, 2, .5), lwd = 0, tck = 0.07,
  lwd.ticks = 1)
axis(1, at = setdiff(cx, seq(0, 2, .5)), labels = NA, lwd.ticks = 1)
box()
```

And finally you change many aspect of them, including color then and line type:


```{R}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5), labels = seq(0, 2, .5), lwd = 0, lwd.ticks = 1.5, tck = -.07, col = 2, lty = 2)
axis(1, at = setdiff(cx, seq(0, 2, .5)), labels = NA, lwd.ticks = .5, tck = -.03, col = 3)
box()
```

One more tip, if you need to adjust the position of the tick you would have to
use `mgp` (also documented in `par`) which is a vector of three elements
controlling the following features:

1. the position of the axis label,
2. the position of the tick labels,
3. the positon on the tick marks.


```{R mgp}
par(mgp = c(2.5, 1.6, 0))
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
axis(2)
axis(1, at = seq(0, 2, .5), labels = seq(0, 2, .5), lwd = 0, lwd.ticks = 1.5,
  tck = -.1, col = 2, lty = 2)
axis(1, at = setdiff(cx, seq(0, 2, .5)), labels = NA, lwd.ticks = .5, tck = -.03, col = 3)
box()
```




## Wrap that up in a function

All what I've done above may appear overwhelming at first because you need to
memorize where is what... But once everything gets clear, you would realize that
for most of your plots you need to tweak the same parameters and so that you
can create your own function that would cover your needs. For instance, I often
use a function similar to the one below:

```{R fun}
myaxis <- function(side, all, main, lab = main, col1 = 1, col2 = 1, ...) {
  axis(side, at = main, labels = lab, lwd = 0, lwd.ticks = 1, col = col1, ...)
  axis(side, at = setdiff(all, main), labels = NA, lwd.ticks = .75, tck = -.025,
    col = col2, ...)
}
```

which is basically makes the customization of tick marks very easy!

```{R final}
plot(cx, cy, axes = FALSE)
myaxis(1, cx, seq(0, 2, .5))
myaxis(2, seq(-0.5, 2.8, .1), seq(-0.5, 2.5, .5), las = 1)
box()
```
