## Context

I've been using a reference manager for 9 years now. During my master and my PhD I used  
[Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/?interaction_required=true) but
when I [to Debian](/2018/01/21/setting-my-debian-stretch-up/) more than 2 years ago
when I siwtched to [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), mainly because
[Elsevier bought Mendeley](https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/08/confirmed-elsevier-has-bought-mendeley-for-69m-100m-to-expand-open-social-education-data-efforts/
) while [Zotero is open-source](https://github.com/zotero/zotero)
and a great initiative of the [Corporation for Digital Scholarship]().

In 2017 the Guardian noted

> Despite the narrow audience, scientific publishing is a remarkably big business. With total global revenues of more than £19bn, it weighs in somewhere between the recording and the film industries in size, but it is far more profitable.

>  In 2013, Elsevier bought Mendeley, primarily a bibliographic tool but also an ASNS (Shaw, 2013) as part of their strategy to acquire a wide range of scholarly online tools and establish themselves as a platform (Robertson, 2018). However, the business model of ASNS and their intentions to monetise the networks remains opaque.[^note1]

From Mendeley to Zotero

I just think it makes to me to swicth to freeware when possible and I acknowledge not always easy but I am use as many software as I can and I am always astoimished to realize how good they are (sometinme it takes some time to master them but they were sure well thpought and well done)

I've used Mendeley. I move and I really think it was time to jump to a free software Zotero.

First version. It took me sometime to change but

What I regret is the search in data base so I coded something...
was relatively easy

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16956810/how-do-i-find-all-files-containing-specific-text-on-linux

grep -rnw Zotero/storage/ -e 'homoge'   


```sh
$ alias seazot='grep -rnw ~/Zotero/storage/ -e'
```

it's all I needed.


### Search in a corpus


I took me sometime to be as performennce as I was, essentieally it has the same fumctionality but it's hard de se défaire de of its old habits.
Zotero 4 then Zotero 5

# What I really like

- duplicate

- better bibtex

- easy to use

- rename from parent file

- data base

- external files

- relatively easy
