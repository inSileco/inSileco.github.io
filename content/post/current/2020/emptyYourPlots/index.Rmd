## Data visualization in R

We do love creating plots with R and we think R offers a fantastic set of tools
to make beautiful graphics. Many websites and blog posts show what you can be
capable with R. Have a look at what [Gaston Sanchez
created](http://www.gastonsanchez.com/Rtist/) and [The R graph Gallery developed
by Yan Holtz](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/). The power is even more with all
the package that take advantage from the JS libraries, for instance
[plotly](https://plot.ly/r/),
[DiagrammR](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/),
[NetworkD3](https://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/),
[Wordcloud2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wordcloud2/vignettes/wordcloud.html),
etc.


There are many ways to create graphics [see our wiki page on this
topic](/content/post/Rgraphpkgs.html). Some people prefer to use base plots
while others prefer to use [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and in some
context it could be very valuable to use interactive plot such the one that can
be drawn with packages that actually turn your R code into a JS code.

Setting apart web-based graphics, there are two R core graphic packages: the
`grid` system and the `graphics` system, both are core packages. We borrow the
image below from [Paul Murrell's paper introducing
`gridGraphics`](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2015/RJ-2015-012/index.html)
that builds a gap between the two core packages (though not for all features)

To illustrate how to start a plot from the scratch and ready to be further
customized we will produce an empty plot with ten points whose coordinates will
be `(0:10, 0:10)`.


## `graphics`-based plots

With `graphics`, the need for emptying your plot is strong if you intend at
creating a custom plot. `graphics` does not allow the user to refresh the viewer
and update it unless you re-execute all the lines. Therefore to customise easier
if you start with and empty plot

```{r}
plot(0:10, 0:10)
```

To empty it

```{r}
plot(0:10, 0:10)
```

if you have a careful look at the code behind `plot.default()` (the one we
actually call here) you will concclure



## `grid`-based plots

It is less clear what you should do when you are using

https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2015/RJ-2015-012/index.html



Before starting a plot actually to customized, remove everything you need...

easy to make your own function

from that to that easier to add something rather that fixing everything and when extremely customized see explicitly what desired.

So...
Let's use a basic plot
and wrote every single peace of code we need.


Note we also made a function for that available here ...

It could be a bit different


There are various way of doing an emply plot, If you google empty plot and
R you should end uo in Stack over flower with different answers that are actually all good√©  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4785657/r-how-to-draw-an-empty-plot

Let's review some of them

plot.new()

pushViewport(vp)
grid.rect(gp=gpar(fill="grey"))


This is something I used a lot to start a new plot but also I like using
here is the duncion I used.

in my package


<!-- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_blank() + theme_void() -->


<!-- ggplot() + geom_area (data=economics, aes(x = date, y = unemploy), linetype=0) +
  scale_x_date(expand = c(0,0)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
 theme_void()
 -->


We mostly often do `graphics`-based plots and so we often do the same combination.
Therefore, we created a function `plot0()` in our package `graphicsutils` available
on [<i class = "fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/inSileco/graphicsutils). We add few extra parameters make it easier.

```r
install_github("inSileco/graphicsutils")
```


```{r}
library(graphicsutils)
plot0(c(0,10))
points(1:9, 1:9)
```

```{r}
plot0(c(0,10), fill='#ebebeb', grid.col = 'white')
points(1:9, 1:9)
```
