## So it begins

A good proportion of people involved in inSileco have one particular expertise
in common: we deal with spatial data. This expertise has been developed through
extensive time importing, creating and formatting spatial data, performing
spatial analyses and building static and dynamic visualization of spatial
objects.

In this blog post series, we propose an educational tour of spatial possibilities
offered by tools developed in the R environment. This series could thus be used
in an educational setting to learn how to use R with R objects.

As is our usual habit, rather than creating a series of posts presenting specific
tools, we will first ask a series of explicitly spatial and ecological questions
and go through the possibilities offered by R to play around with spatial tools.

## What I wrote few months ago

Since the last decade, new softwares have emerged making the creation and
edition of maps accessible to all. Scientists can now readily draw valuable
spatial representations of their work without deep knowledge in mapping
(I recommend the reading of the Nature's article [â€œScience on the
Map"](http://www.nature.com/news/data-visualization-science-on-the-map-1.17024).
by Zastrow, Mark - 2015. Basic mapping skills should be a part of educational
background of many scientists as maps are often a proper way to expose facts and
thereby a valuable tool to ease the scientific debate. Among the tools available
(see below) some Geographic Information System (GIS) are free, open-source such
as [Quantum GIS](http://qgis.org/en/site/) and [GRASS GIS](http://grass.osgeo.org).
Also, some high-level programming languages such as JavaScript, Python,
or R offer dedicated packages. A couple are listed a couple of softwares:


- [ArcGIS](http://www.arcgis.com/features/)
- [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com)
- [DIVA-GIS](http://www.diva-gis.org)
- [GeoJson](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0)
- [Google Map](https://www.google.fr/maps)
- [Goole Earth](http://www.google.fr/intl/eng/earth/index.html)
- [GRASS](http://grass.osgeo.org)
- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com)
- [Mapinfo](http://www.mapinfo.com)
- [Mapnik](http://mapnik.org)
- [PostGIS](http://www.postgis.org)
- [Quantum GIS](http://qgis.org/en/site/)
- [SAGA GIS](http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html)
- [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/)





  ## Why use R for mapping?

  Given the number of tools dedicated to visualization and analyses of spatial
  data, it is important that users ask this question and take some time and balance
  pros ans cons. According to me, the choice strongly relies upon (i) your
  ambition in term of mapping and (ii) your R skills. If you aim at creating a
  good-looking map without analysis and you are not familiar with R, it does not
  make any sense to use R only for mapping. But if you are familiar with R, you
  can quickly get a good-looking map (a R plot basically) and then benefit from
  the plot system you already know. Also, when you need tricky spatial analysis,
  even if you are not familiar with R, you will doubtlessly may benefit from
  learning it.
