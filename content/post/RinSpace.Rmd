# So it begins

A good proportion of people involved in inSileco have one particular expertise
in common: we deal with spatial data. This expertise has been developed through
extensive time importing, creating and formatting spatial data, performing
spatial analyses and building static and dynamic visualization of spatial
objects.

In this blog post series, we propose an educational tour of spatial possibilities
offered by tools developed in the R environment. This series could thus be used
in an educational setting to learn how to use R with R objects.

As is our usual habit, rather than creating a series of posts presenting specific
tools, we will first ask a series of explicitly spatial and ecological questions
and go through the possibilities offered by R to play around with spatial tools.
