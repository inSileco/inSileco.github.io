## So it begins

A fair proportion of people involved in inSileco have one particular expertise
in common: we work extensively with spatial data. This expertise has been
developed through extensive time importing, creating and formatting spatial
data, performing spatial analyses and building static and dynamic spatial
visualizations.

In this blog post series, we propose an educational tour of spatial possibilities
offered by tools developed in the R environment. This series could thus be used
in an educational setting to learn how to use R in Space!

As is our usual habit, rather than creating a series of posts presenting specific
tools, we will first ask a series of explicitly spatial and ecological questions
and go through the possibilities offered by R to play around with spatial tools.

We must mention Quebec Ocean...
