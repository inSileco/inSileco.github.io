### About

All authors of this blog are ecologists and modelers and therefore inclined to write blog posts related to both ecology and modeling. As modelers, we use various computational tools. However, given the current prevalence of R among ecologists, we tend to write more about R than other programming langages. This website it-self is been built with Rmarkdown which is a very convenient way to write about R.
