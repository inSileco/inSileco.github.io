### About

All authors of this blog are ecologists and modelers and therefore inclined to
write blog posts related to both ecology and modeling. As modelers, we use
various computational tools. However, given the current prevalence of R among
ecologists, we tend to write more about R than other programming languages. This
website it-self is built with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/),
a very convenient way to write about R. Note that we are sharing our R-related
post on [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com) "a blog aggregator of content
contributed by bloggers who write about R" and there are literally [**hundreds**
of bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/blogs-list/) that contribute to it.
