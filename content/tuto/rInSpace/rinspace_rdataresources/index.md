## R data resources

With the R community as vibrant and dynamic as it is, there are an increasingly
high number of online data resources readily available to users through simple
lines of command. The best hub of R packages making online data available to R
users is actively developed by the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) group.
This non-profit organization aims at *foster*[ing] *a culture
that values open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable
software*. Data access tools is however not limited to this group and a quick
search reveals the wealth of data not available to R users.

In this post, we will explore some valuable geospatial resources that are
accessible using R. We do not mean to provide a thorough review of each resource,
but rather provide a list <!-- and a glimpse into --> of valuable resources for
geospatial data in R and invite readers to consult specific package material
for further detail.
