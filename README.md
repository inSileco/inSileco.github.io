The overarching goal of this blog is quite straightforward: tackle challenges
and opportunities provided by this new era of open-access and computationally
intensive research in the field of ecology.



## Getting started

Our blog created with the great [blogdown :package:](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), built and deployed by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/inSileco/inSileco.github.io.svg?branch=dev).

See [our wiki :book:](https://github.com/inSileco/inSileco.github.io/wiki/GetStarted) to learn how to contribute to the blog!



### Color palette

We used a set of colors throughout the website:

- Main: "#3fb3b2";
- Yellow-logo: "#ffdd55";
- red code: "#c7254e";
- blue twitter: "#1b95e0";
- purple kevcaz: "#8555b4"
- So the palette is `c("#3fb3b2". "#ffdd55", "#c7254e", "#1b95e0", "#8555b4")`
