## inSileco blogdown

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/inSileco/inSileco.github.io.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/inSileco/inSileco.github.io)


The overarching goal of this blog is quite straightforward: tackle challenges
and opportunities provided by this new era of open-access and computationally
intensive research in the field of ecology.



### Getting started

#### Install blogdown

```r
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')
```

If you want more info on how this package works, have a look at the blogdown [documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), you can also have
a quick look at [this blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/11/announcing-blogdown/).

#### Deploy the server

0. Make sure you're at the `HEAD` of the`dev` branch and in the inSileco.github.io folder.
1. Open a terminal and run: `Rscript -e 'blogdown::serve_site()'`
2. Site is available at `http://127.0.0.1:4321` from your browser.

If any changes are made on source files, the site will be autogenerated and changes will be displayed at the `localhost` address (`http://127.0.0.1:4321`).

#### Writing your own post

0. Make sure you're at the `HEAD` of the `dev` branch and in the inSileco.github.io folder.
1. You can messily create a new empty post with:

```r
Rscript -e 'blogdown::new_post('MY_TITLE')'
```

Alternatively, you can use

```
hugo new post/yourpost.Rmd
```

which will use the archetype `post.Rmd`.
